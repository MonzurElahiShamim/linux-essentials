**lsd** is like the `ls` command on steroids. It's a tool that makes your directory listings look a lot nicer and provides more information. Think of it as adding some color and flair to your terminal.

**Basic Usage:**

- Just type `lsd` in your terminal to see the magic.

**Key Features:**

- **Colors:** Files and directories are displayed in different colors for easy identification.
- **Icons:** Files and directories are represented by icons for a visual touch.
- **Customization:** You can tweak the output to show details like file size, modification time, and permissions.
- **Tree view:** View your directory structure like a tree.

**Example:**

```bash
lsd -l
```

This command will show a long listing with file types represented by icons.
